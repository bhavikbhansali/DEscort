# DEscort
This is the project we develop for Rajasthan Hackathon 4.0. Our we made a Device which is AR based as well as mobile application which is based on qrcode. We made this solution and propose it under  tourism theme.

What is Our Solution?
So basically we propose two solutions one is for indoor enviourment and another one is for outdoor enviourment.

Indoor:
Fo this catagory we have a AR device which is currently  looks like cap as it is proto but it will convert into glasses. So lets assume you are going to visit museum now a days you find a device which is sensor/sensorless audio information psson device which is eniter automatically or mannual and in automatic it will very diffecult to handel becaus if you are in range of rf transmitter/sensor it will automatically plays the video  which means if you are not looking at the thing still it start audio. So our system have ar vision system where if you look at any of the thing it will read the AR code which is puted on a fix location. We made a device in a such a way that it will track your head and where ever you see it will not scan it and play a relevent video. ALso this device is having wireless bluetooth remote from which you can control your media player like play, pasue, stop, skip 10s+, skip 10s-, volume +, volumr -. We made device such a way that if you use your mobile or other app no video will play as we propsing which is very tightly
